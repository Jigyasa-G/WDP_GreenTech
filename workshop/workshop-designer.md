# Proposal to use Azure Machine Learning designer
This is one of the ideas I came up with based on the use of: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-regression-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/ 

Benefits: Easy to use and deploy. 
          It allows us to focus only on the implementation and does not necessarily require a lot of experience in the use of ML.
## 

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

> List your established goals of the workshop experience here. These are the takeaways that you want students to have after completing the workshop.

1. Students will be skilled at: 
        Get an introduction to machine learning
        Use the automated machine learning capability of Azure Machine Learning to train and deploy a predictive model.
        
2. Students will be able to independently use their learning to:
        Identify use cases for predictive models linked to sustainability.

3. Students will undersand the concepts of : 
        The use of technology in promoting environmental sustainability. 

## Stage 2: Evidence

> List any evaluative criteria and Assessment Evidence. Students will demonstrate their understanding of the concepts by doing the following:
 
1. Performance Tasks (these are tasks that a student can complete to demonstrate comprehension, such as a quiz or code challenge): 
   Short quiz in AI concepts on MS Learn AI. 
2. Short quiz on the objectives related to sustainability.(?)

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

> Now you are ready to build out your lesson plan. There is a [template](./template/README.md) available for this purpose. Summarize the key learning events here by creating an outline of the milestones that you can lay out to structure the course.

1. List the key learning events in the workshop - for a one-hour workshop, we recommend 5 milestones

## Milestone 1 (Setup)

```javascript
//code snippets to aid in the building process
```

> *tips, tricks, callouts*
