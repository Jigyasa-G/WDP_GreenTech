# UBD: Understanding By Design

The UBD technique of curriculum design was created by Jay McTighe and Grant Wiggins and outlined in their book, "[Understanding By Design](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Design-second-Grant-Wiggins/dp/B006NPF8D0/ref=sr_1_15?crid=26FTBZ6E9Q53K&keywords=understanding+by+design&qid=1636052567&sprefix=understanding+by+design%2Caps%2C94&sr=8-15)" and its companion [Handbook](https://1lib.us/book/910241/cd96e1). UBD is a process of "backwards design" where the curriculum designer works through three stages, starting with the desired goals of the learning experience and moving backwards through assessments and then to the lesson design. It bears some similarities to TDD (test-driven development) processes in Engineering, where tests are to be written before the code. Use this template to outline your workshop's desired outcomes.

## 

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

> List your established goals of the workshop experience here. These are the takeaways that you want students to have after completing the workshop.

1. Students will be skilled at: 
        Get an introduction to machine learning
        Use the automated machine learning capability of Azure Machine Learning to train and deploy a predictive model.
        
2. Students will be able to independently use their learning to:
        Identify use cases for predictive models linked to sustainability.

3. Students will undersand the concepts of : 
        The use of technology in promoting environmental sustainability. 

## Stage 2: Evidence

> List any evaluative criteria and Assessment Evidence. Students will demonstrate their understanding of the concepts by doing the following:
 
1. Performance Tasks (these are tasks that a student can complete to demonstrate comprehension, such as a quiz or code challenge): 
   Short quiz in AI concepts on MS Learn AI. 
2. Short quiz on the objectives related to sustainability.(?)

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

> Now you are ready to build out your lesson plan. There is a [template](./template/README.md) available for this purpose. Summarize the key learning events here by creating an outline of the milestones that you can lay out to structure the course.

1. List the key learning events in the workshop - for a one-hour workshop, we recommend 5 milestones

## Milestone 1 (Setup)

```javascript
//code snippets to aid in the building process
```

> *tips, tricks, callouts*

## Milestone 2 (Be one with sustainability)

```javascript
//code snippets to aid in the building process
```

> *tips, tricks, callouts*

## Milestone 3 (Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace)

```javascript
//code snippets to aid in the building process
```

> *tips, tricks, callouts*

## Milestone 4 (Explore Data)

```javascript
//code snippets to aid in the building process
```

> *tips, tricks, callouts*

## Milestone 5 (Create and run training pipeline)

```javascript

```

## Milestone 6 (Undestand and Test the model)

```javascript

```
## Milestone 7 (Deploy the model and consume the endpoint)

```javascript
//code snippets to aid in the building process
```

## Milestone 8 (Knowlegde check)
