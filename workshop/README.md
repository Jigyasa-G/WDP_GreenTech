# Predict solar energy usage with Machine Learning Designer.

## Overview

In this workshop you will learn how to create a predictive machine learning model through the [Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-designer).
You will be able to forecast the production of solar energy in a panel, based on climatic data and with it start on your way to a more sustainable life.

| **Project Goal**              | *Learn about Machine Learning model and how to train and deploy a predictive model*                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What will you learn**       | Identify use cases for predictive models linked to sustainability.The use of technology in promoting environmental sustainability.                                        |
| **What you'll need**          | Internet Connection, an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com),ability to navigate the Azure portal,basic concepts of Python and Pandas|
| **Duration**                  | 1-1.5 hours                                                               |
| **Just want to try the app or see the solution?** | *a link to the completed project sample app or solution folder*                          |
| **Slides** | [Powerpoint](slides.pptx)                          |
