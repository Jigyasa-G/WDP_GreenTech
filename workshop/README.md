# Predict solar energy usage with Machine Learning Designer.

## Overview

In this workshop you will learn how to create a predictive machine learning model through the [Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-designer).
You will be able to forecast the production of solar energy in a panel, based on climatic data and with it start on your way to a more sustainable life.

## Milestone 1: Machine Learning and Regresion Models. 

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is the foundation of most AI solutions, using math and statistics to build predictive models for unknown values. 

Machines learn from data, every day we create a large amount of information that can be collected and used by data scientists to train a machine learning model and create predictions and inferences based on the relationships found in the information.

The following video gives us several examples of how a machine learning model works.

### Regression models in machine learning

The Regression is a form of machine learning that is used to predict a numeric label based on an item's features,  in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to fit the feature combinations to the label. Then, after training has been completed, you can use the trained model to predict labels for new items for which the label is unknown.

## Milestone 2: Be one with sustainability 

Among the great challenges we have today is the fact of promoting sustainability within our lives to face problems such as climate change and carbon emissions. 

In an effort to generate change, we have made this workshop so that you can see how feasible it is to use solar panels in a region based on information from a region and thus have an energy generation without emissions that is more friendly to the environment.

You can also be an agent of change within your projects by taking into account the [eight principles of sustainable software engineering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/sustainable-software-engineering-overview/).
